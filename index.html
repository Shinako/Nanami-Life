<p><font color="red">My favorite Movie is called The Tale of Despereaux, because when it came out i had,had an arguement with my family about mice vs rats and it helped prove my side of the arguement. In Addition to that It's a refreshing comedy that can brighten any body mood with the theme "small mouse, big dreams".
